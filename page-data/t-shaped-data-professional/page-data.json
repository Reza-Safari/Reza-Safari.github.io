Both articles mention the fractured nature of \\u201CData Science Community\\u201D and both have great advice depending on who you are, which is why I recommend reading both before continuing here. Seriously.\\nFor example, I can use the soft skills and the business impact described by Vincent Granville (Generalist advocate in this case) to describe both of the job descriptions above. But I can also use a mixture of job specializations used by Jeremie Harris (the specialist advocate in this case) to describe each of the jobs above (Eg. The WeWork is an example of Analyst & Data Scientist where Spotify is Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineer/Researcher).\\nWhere I would vote for refinement of arguments in each article is by introducing the T-Shaped professional. A T-Shaped data professional has specializations, but is also able to contribute and be aware of discussions in the other areas of this wide realm we call Data Science. The T-Shaped data scientist has actually been promoted often, here in an O\\u2019Reilly Report in 2013 (6 years ago when Frozen was first released).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"What\\u2019s changed here is that we\\u2019ve started getting more granular with the skills you need.

Simply put, I know where and how to handle Terabytes of data, model it, process it where necessary and expose it for various other professionals.\\nBroad Expertise Knowledge and Toolkit:\\nBasic statistics.\\nWhy it matters: I know how to determine a decent sample size, I can perform basic descriptive stats to know if a data set is potentially representative of the question.\\nProduct knowledge.\\nWhy it matters: When business users or other members of the team ask questions regarding data availability and accessibility, I know our product metrics enough to advise them.\\nMachine Learning.\\nWhy it matters: I can be an authoritative source on the availability, shape and quality of data for machine learning projects. As part of the team, my knowledge and experience can ensure the setup for Continuous Integration and Deployment environment. Also, given that most of time spent in Machine Learning is in the data cleaning and processing step, my strong ETL knowledge allows for feature engineering which researchers might not even have dreamt off.\\nBusiness Analytics.\\nWhy it matters: Business analytics is a bit general here, being used to describe both metric development as well as requirement gathering.
