A rundown of interesting / neat / thought provoking encountered during the week.

### Reading

- [Wired's Expose on the Marcus Hutchins and WannaCry](https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-marcus-hutchins-hacker-who-saved-the-internet/)

Highly recommended read. Specially the bitter-sweet ending, depending on how you look at it.

### Interesting Things

- [Using Pareto Efficiency to rank Mario Kart Characters](https://medium.com/civis-analytics/the-best-mario-kart-character-according-to-data-science-7dfb65d4c18e)

A simple method (compared to training a deep net for months to learn to play Mario Kart), presented in an actionable format.

### Stats

- [Python 2019 Developer Survey](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2019/)

It's always fun picking through these surveys, and this once is certainly really interesting on understanding how Python is being used.

Main takeaway for myself:

- Python seems to be well adopted in Web Development
    - Flask / Django (might rebuild this site to be a flask static app in the near future)
- For DBs, SQL OLAP offerings, specially the licence-free flavor dominate. Cloud barely gets any love
    - PostgreSQL
    - MySQL
    - SQLite

I previously thought the recent Python drive was due to it's scripting capabilities, and then the data science / analytics community adoption pushed it over the edge(or so it was in my case).
But from this survey is seems like Python is actually very well utilized in the Web Dev community with Django and Flask.

I'd be keen on a use case split, to know if this survey is skewed (i.e sample is more web development community than actual) or if it is representative (i.e the python community is actually majority web development)
